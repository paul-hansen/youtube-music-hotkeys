A Google Chrome extension for setting global hotkeys to control YouTube music.
No longer works due to Google breaking all Chrome extensions in their fight against ad blockers.

It's a very simple extension but it had just under 11,000 users on the chrome store before being removed.
When Google decided to drop manifest V2 support, I couldn't spend the time to upgrade it so it was eventually made defunct by Google and I was starting to get bad reviews about that so I delisted it from the store.

It's possible I'll bring it back someday but money is tight right now so I need to focus on things that are sources of income.

Personally I made this because when YouTube music launched it didn't support media hotkeys at all, they do now so I'm kind of confused why so many people were still using this.
I would guess it was so you can use different key bindings or perhaps it worked around some Windows hotkeys handling problems. I just use my media keys and Linux now.

Making this open source because people kept asking me to. I don't currently provide support for it in any way.
Donations would be just a way to say thank you for open sourcing it, though if I got enough (couple hundred ish? idk) I might consider upgrading it and relisting it.
